    "While the original Pearson test showed no corelation between new cases per million people and the percentage of population vaccinated, this is not true in the 'older countries' subset of my sample (Countries with a Human Development Index greater than 0.9, in 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "For those countries with more than 12.9% of their population aged 70 or older, there is a weak positive correlation between the number of new cases per million people and the percentage of population vaccinated (r = 0.162, p < 0.001). This suggests that the more people vaccinated, the more people infected with covid-19! This seems highly unlikely, and I assume there is something else going on. If you look at the graphs, you can see that the data for the older countries is concentrated in the 0 - 10 % vaccinated region, suggesting not much vaccination has actually occured in these countries, and so perhaps we don't currently have enough data to be drawing proper conclusions, I would strongly suggest in this case that correlation does not equal causation!\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, although the Pearson correlation test showed a stronger correlation in the older countries between the number of new deaths per million people and the percentage of population vaccinated (r = -0.196, p < 0.001) than in the younger countries (r = -0.106, p < 0.001), or overall (r = -0.138, p < 0.001), the issues stated above suggest we should interpret that with caution."
